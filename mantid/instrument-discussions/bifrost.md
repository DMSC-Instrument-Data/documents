a4 = tank rotation -> continuous scan
a3 = sample scan

stroboscopic measurements

S(Q,\omega) -> actually S(Q_1, Q_2, \omega) (absolutely essential from day 1 of hot commissioning)
  -> check what SofQw does in Mantid
time scale seconds to minutes

up to 5 GigaBins

## Monitors

- scans -> need time resolved monitors
- no single shot, monitors integrated over intervals of seconds-minutes
- details still open

## Non-straigh beam path

- path component approx. should be fine
- current fudging also

- L1 might be wavelength dependent (will be simulated soon)!


- normalization for detectors and for analysis (actually combined)

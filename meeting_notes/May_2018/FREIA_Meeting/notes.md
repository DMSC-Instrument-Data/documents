Meeting with Thomas Arnold. Lamar Moore also present.

* Currently working towards tollgate 2 set for Autumn 2018
* FREIA is to be one of the last instruments in the suite
* Currently working through various McStas simulations, trying different chopper setups, and using a "rainbow mode" (prism) setup instead of choppers
* They have some custom scripts in Matlab (written by Hannah?) for performing the data reduction
* Would like to validate some of the simulations by performing data reduction plotting results etc
* Detector is a 2D bank with a constant curvature
* Due to Lamar being away, we would not be able to work on this till Mid June.

Actions:
* Lamar see if we can run the simulations and create the geometry and data files directly from mcstas (see email 21st May 2018). If so, check that the geometries match those in the input file. Should check L1 and L2s in addition to the position of things. It might be that a separate physical and neutroic instrument representation are needed.
* Owen try to compare matlab scripts to the reflectometry reduction procedure in matlab. Any surprises?
* If the two above are OK, attempt to reduce the data in Mantid and provide back to Thomas Arnold

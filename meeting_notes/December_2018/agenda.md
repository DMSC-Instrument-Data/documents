Live event-streaming performance
----

### Wednesday
- 12:30 - 13:15 - Lamar and Dan arrive (Lunch)
- 13:15 - 14:15 - Revisit requirements (pixel counts, timeline)
- 14:15 - 15:30 - Discuss changes implemented by Lamar after benchmarking listener performance.
- 15:30 - 16:30 - Discuss/Discover potential performance bottlenecks

### Thursday 
- 9:00 - 12:00 - What do we actually need (Capture the requirements for the listener)?
  - For example: If it is just for the instrument view, we do not actually require a event list for every pixel --- a single intensity value and a way to obtain the histogram would be sufficient.
- 12:00 - 13:00 - Lunch (Lamar will possibly meet with Jon Taylor at this time).
- 13:00 - 15:00 - Discuss different approaches to resolving bottlenecks (may or may not require MPI)
  - What other solutions are there, apart from MPI.
- 15:00 - 16:30 - If enough progress is made, start sketching prototype.

### Friday
- 9:00 - 11:00 - Final discussions/prototyping
- 11:00 - 12:00 - Discuss 2019 High-level milestones.
- 12:00 - Lamar depart..

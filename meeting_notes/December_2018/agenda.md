Live event-streaming performance
----

- Revisit requirements (pixel counts, timeline)
- What do we actually need?
  - For example: If it is just for the instrument view, we do not actually require a event list for every pixel --- a single intensity value and a way to obtain the histogram would be sufficient.
- Understand where the actual performance issue is.
- What other solutions are there, apart from MPI.

## Discussions

### MD Work
* Overview by Dan Nixon 
* How to continue resourcing this. PACE crossover etc. MD Work? 

### Planning
* Look at [plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16z5WiGysXqssw5GFhP05LpfEnmoU-sBeT-HiZSGOzAA/edit#gid=669025093) with Jon Taylor
  * New plan to include new staff if possible

* Instrument Team Requirements
  * Imaging [sine2020](https://github.com/DMSC-Instrument-Data/documents/blob/8f3abf8cbc951a23e1d3eeeec0285c039cded9ed/meeting_notes/June_2018_Italy/imaging_questions.md)
  
### Workspace2
* Overview of Type Erasure (best design so far)
* Discuss roadmap to complete design and get in front of PMB for resourcing

### Hardware Requirements 
* Probably best led by Simon and Lamar
* The DAaaS Model - this has wider scope than Data Reduction. Should be discussed with Jon. For detailed discussion would need to involve SCD

### Mantid Workbench
[TODO] will probably involve Martyn and Nick Draper in this.

### Crystallography
* Discuss a shared resource pool (Sam will be absent). General agreement within SCD dev teams that concept development would be very useful and is badly lacking in Mantid.
* NXTools?

## Other Activities 

* ISIS Tour (Freddie organising)
* Meet ISIS Mantid Dev Team (Maybe go round and see what people are working on?)
* Meet ISIS IBEX Dev Team

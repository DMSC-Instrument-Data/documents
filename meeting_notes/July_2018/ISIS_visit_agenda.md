### Workspace2
* Overview of Type Erasure (best design so far)

### Hardware Requirements 
* Live Data measurements (Lamar)
* The [DAaaS](https://github.com/DMSC-Instrument-Data/documents/blob/master/meeting_notes/May_2018/DAaaS.md) Model - this has wider scope than Data Reduction. Should be discussed with Jon. For detailed discussion would need to involve SXD 

### Mantid Workbench
Martyn to lead discussion on this

### Crystallography
* Discuss a shared resource pool (Sam will be absent). General agreement within SXD dev teams that concept development would be very useful and is badly lacking in Mantid.
* NXTools?

## Other Activities

* Meet ISIS Mantid Dev Team (Maybe go round and see what people are working on?)

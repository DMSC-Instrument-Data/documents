# Description of pure event type algorithms

In this document we want to describe MDAlgorithms which exclusively operate on
histogram-type workspaces. It is not intention to give an algorithmically exact
representation of the algorithms but rather to get a good understanding of their
functionality and their dependence on data-structure-specific features.

This investigation is currently halted, since histogram-type algorithms are not
a bottle-neck at the moment and it does not look like they will be a big issue.

\section{Motivation}

This is your opportunity for influencing the design and features of the experiment control software and live data reduction for ESS.
In particular, your comments will allows us to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Ensure that features that you need for your experiment are built in from the beginning.
  \item Ensure that the design is capable of dealing with your favourite work flows during an experiment.
  \item Ensure that the software framework is capable of dealing with performance requirements, to give a fluid and non-frustrating user experience.
\end{itemize}
This is certainly an early stage for many instrument developments, but it is important that we get as much input and feedback as possible at this point.
It allows us to decide:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Where to focus development efforts.
  \item What hardware might be necessary and what it might cost.
\end{itemize}
The next section contains a series of question:
\begin{itemize}
  \item This list of questions is just a guideline, feel free to ignore or add items or comments as needed.
  \item For most questions we are giving a few possible replies as sub-items.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item These are suggestions, and there are probably many more options.
      \item Please add more when required.
      \item Multiple answers a definitely ok.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Some items are set in {\color{black!60} grey}.
    Those are more specific to data reduction and may be ignored when considering the experiment control software.
    We plan to discuss those with each instrument team individually at a later point.
\end{itemize}


\section{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What do you find at existing facilities that limit what you can do?
  \item User sits down in front of computer to run their experiment.
    What do they need to (or want to) do, typically?
    What are common work flows?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Start script, wait till end of run?
      \item Initial manual setup/tuning, start measurement, wait till end of run?
      \item Lots of manual interaction during most of the run?
    \end{itemize}
  \item What do users need to see during the experiment?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item ``What is the detector seeing now?''
      \item Integral over the full length of the run?
      \item Compare data from different parameters regions of the run (e.g., different $T$)?
    \end{itemize}
  \item What are typical time-scales during a run (latencies, changing experiment parameters)?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item For (visual) feedback (e.g., an intensity plot)?
      \item For manual control?
      \item For automated control?
    \end{itemize}
  \item What ``mode'' would you most likely want to use:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Start-stop.
      \item Gather data continuously.
        If so, why?
    \end{itemize}
  \item What kind of interaction with the live data reduction is required \emph{during a run}?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item None.
      \item Simple (re-bin, create plots for data from earlier in the run).
      \item Change parameters of reduction script (examples appreciated).
      \item Create/modify reduction script while running.
    \end{itemize}
  \item What do you want to do with event mode that you can not do at existing facilities?
  \item What would event mode be used for?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Not crucial during experiment.
      \item Filtering (on what aspects?).
      \item Re-binning.
      \item Other.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Is some kind of triggering required?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What parameters from a reduction result would you want to use to steer an experiment automatically?
    \end{itemize}
  \item What are typical time periods for gathering or accumulating data?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item With fixed experiment conditions (same $T$, same $p$, same everything)?
      \item With varying conditions (e.g., a temperature ramp)?
    \end{itemize}
  {\color{black!60}
  \item Monitors:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item What kinds of monitors will the instrument have?
      \item Will monitors run in event mode?
        What event rates are to be expected?
      \item If yes, is this required in the reduction (for what reasons)?
      \item Can we circumvent event mode by histogramming the monitors on, e.g., a per-pulse basis?
    \end{itemize}
  }
  {\color{black!60}
  \item Is there anything that you have to or want to do with the 3D detectors?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item No.
      \item Unclear.
      \item Find trajectories to remove scattering by anything but the sample.
    \end{itemize}
  }
  \item What needs to be stored during a run?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Plots, e.g., $I(Q)$ plot?
      \item Big ``reduced'' data (i.e., before integrating, slicing, and plotting)?
        {\color{black!60}
        If not, will users typically re-reduce things after the experiment or are most of them happy with the plots obtained during the experiment?
        }
    \end{itemize}
  \item For the questions above, are there big differences between:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Normal users?
      \item Power users?
      \item Instrument scientist?
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
